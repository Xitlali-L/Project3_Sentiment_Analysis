# Project3_Sentiment_Analysis

Xitlali Lopez, CS5393-002_Project3, Collaborator: Naomi Murrieta

Design Doc: 
We are praticing using git and github to program a sentiment analysis and determine whether a tweet text has positive or negative implications.
We create our own string called DSString and create a DSString class for its operations where we allocate memory and use the rule of three to manage the memory created. We create a training section where the frequency of a word in either a positive or neegative determines its sentiment value. Then create a testing section where the list of positive or negative words from training are compared to a correct dataset lsit of the sentiment values. After the comparizion we calcuate the accuracy of our sentiment analysis by dividing the number of correctly classfied tweets by the total number of tweets in the test dataset.
